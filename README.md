In the Master Thesis "Photogrammetry for 3D Reconstruction in SOLIDWORKS and its Applications in Industry" Nikhil S. Potabatti wrote an Alicevision-Addon for SolidWorks.

Since the source code is provided as screenshot only and I could not find a way to contact the author I decided to publish the code here so it can be used. If you are the author, you are welcome to contact me via the Issues.

What about copy rights or the license of the code?

On the [official website](https://scholarworks.iupui.edu/handle/1805/19992) the following license is stated:

CC0 1.0 Universal (CC0 1.0)

Since nothing else is stated in the thesis I assume the same license applies for the code.
